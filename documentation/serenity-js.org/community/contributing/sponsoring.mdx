# Sponsoring Serenity/JS

Delivering new features, writing documentation, answering your questions on GitHub, StackOverflow and Gitter, and making sure that Serenity/JS is up-to-date with all the security patches and bug fixes take **a lot of time**.

We're talking about an average of **40-100 hours** per maintainer per month **on top** of our day jobs, for which none of us are getting paid.
We're using the GitHub Sponsors program to help raise funds and secure development time to make Serenity/JS better for everyone! ðŸš€

If you feel that Serenity/JS has helped you save at least a couple of dollars worth of your time, please support our work by joining the Serenity/JS [GitHub Sponsors programme](https://github.com/sponsors/serenity-js)!

:::tip Did you know?
As a thank you for your support, you'll also get a sponsor badge on your GitHub profile and access to exclusive tutorials and best practice articles to help take your Serenity/JS skills to the next level!
