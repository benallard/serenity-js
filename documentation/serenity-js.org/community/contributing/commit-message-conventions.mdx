# Commit message conventions

[Serenity/JS Continuous Delivery Pipeline](https://github.com/serenity-js/serenity-js/blob/main/.github/workflows/main.yaml) uses [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) standard and analyses the files you've modified to determine if the changes you propose **require version bump and a release**.

For example, changes to **any files** in the [`packages`](https://github.com/serenity-js/serenity-js/tree/main/packages) directory
will result in a release of the new version of Serenity/JS to [npmjs.com](https://www.npmjs.com/org/serenity-js) and the [Serenity/JS website](https://serenity-js.org) being updated,
while changes to **any files** in the [`documentation`](https://github.com/serenity-js/serenity-js/tree/main/documentation) will only result in the website being updated.

Additionally, if your changes are marked as `feat` or `fix`, they will be included in the [changelog and release notes](/changelog/). For example:
- `docs(website): corrected a typo in the handbook` will not be included in the changelog
- `feat(console-reporter): improved stats aggregation` will be included in the changelog

:::info Your commit messages matter
Please pay attention to what you write in your commit messages, as messages marked as `feat` and `fix` are included in the [changelog and release notes](/changelog/).

## Handling Pull Requests that trigger a release

When you raise a Pull Request, the Serenity/JS pipeline will automatically calculate the version number based on the commit messages and the files you've modified, according to the following rules:
- if your Pull Request contains a single commit with a `fix` message, e.g. `fix(core): corrected a typo in the API docs`, the pipeline will bump the **patch** version of the affected module, e.g. `@serenity-js/core`, and other Serenity/JS modules that rely on it and release them together to npmjs.com.
- if your Pull Request contains a commit with a `feat` message, the pipeline will bump the **minor** version
- if your Pull Request contains multiple commits, some of which are `fix`, some `feat`, some `style`, `refactor` or `docs`, the pipeline will determine the most significant change and bump the **minor** version if there's at least one `feat` commit, or the **patch** version if there are only `fix` commits.

:::tip Serenity/JS Continuous Delivery Pipeline
The Serenity/JS pipeline runs **thousands of package- and integration-level tests** across a number of supported Node.js runtimes, browsers,
and operating systems to help make sure new changes don't introduce regressions and takes only about 15 minutes to complete üöÄ

### Squashing Pull Requests

If your Pull Requests contains **multiple commits** affecting the same feature, it's fine to have the various commits follow the `feat(scope): description` and `fix(scope): description` format, as the pipeline will still calculate the version number based on the most significant change
while including all `feat` and `fix` commits in the changelog and release notes.

However, if you **don't want to have all your `feat` and `fix` commits to be added to the changelog and release notes**, please
let us know in the description of your Pull Request and make sure that the **title of your Pull Request follows the commit message standard instead**.

## Commit message wizard

To make getting the commit message format easy for you, we've added a little **commit message wizard** that will help you generate a commit message compliant with the standard.
We've also configured a pre-commit git hooks and a CI/CD pipeline-level check to ensure everything's correct.

If you get stuck at any point, please feel free to reach out on the [Serenity/JS Community Chat](https://matrix.to/#/#serenity-js:gitter.im) and we'll help you out.

To use the commit message wizard, add the files you changed to [git index](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-add) using `git add <filename>`, or your favourite IDE like [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/versioncontrol) or [JetBrains](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/commit-and-push-changes.html#set-passwords-for-git-remotes)

Next, invoke the following command in the root directory of your cloned Serenity/JS project:

```sh npm2yarn
npm run commit
```

Which should yield output similar to the below:

```sh npm2yarn
npm run commit

> serenity-js-monorepo@3.0.0-monorepo commit
> bin/commit.ts

? Select the TYPE of change you're proposing:
  feat:     A new feature that will be available to the developers using Serenity/JS, e.g. a new public API
‚ùØ fix:      A bug fix, prepared typically to address a specific GitHub ticket
  docs:     Documentation only changes affecting the website, examples, or the API docs
  style:    Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code, e.g. formatting, fixing missing semicolons, etc.
  refactor: Improvements to code that do not affect the observable behaviour of Serenity/JS
  perf:     A code change aimed at improving performance
  test:     Improvements to existing internal tests, or adding missing tests
(Move up and down to reveal more choices)
```

For example, if you wanted to make a documentation change to the Serenity/JS website to explain the importance of commit messages, you'd select:
`docs` as the type of change, and `website` as the scope of the change:
```sh
All lines except first will be wrapped after 100 characters.
? Select the TYPE of change you're proposing: docs
? Denote the SCOPE of this change: website

? WHAT did you change? Please write a SHORT, IMPERATIVE tense description of the change:

 explained the importance of commit messages

? WHY did you change it? Provide a LONGER description of the motivation behind the change (optional).
  Use "|" to break new line

 This should help developers follow the commit message format conventions |
 and make contributing to Serenity/JS easier

? List any GitHub TICKETS affected by this change (optional). E.g.: #31, #34:
 closes #2263

###--------------------------------------------------------###
docs(website): explained the importance of commit messages

This should help developers follow the commit message format conventions
and make contributing to Serenity/JS easier

? Are you sure you want to proceed with the commit above? (Yneh)

```

:::tip Referencing and closing GitHub tickets
If your change is related to a specific GitHub ticket, please mention it in your commit message when the wizard asks about it, e.g. `#2263`.

If your change should _close_ the related ticket altogether,
please use the [`closes #<ticket number>` syntax](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue#linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue-using-a-keyword), e.g. `closes #2263`.

Once you're happy with the commit message, push your commit to your forked repository, and [raise a pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request).
