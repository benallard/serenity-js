# Reporting issues

If you believe you have found a bug in Serenity/JS please raise a ticket using the [Serenity/JS GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/serenity-js/serenity-js/issues).

When reporting a bug, please kindly **remember that the easier you make it for the maintainers to "see what you see", the sooner your ticket will be looked at**:
- Give the ticket a **succinct yet descriptive title** - compare "Feature X is broken" vs, "Feature X is not triggered upon event Y"
- Mention the **environment** where you spotted the bug. What was the browser and operating system? What versions of runtime dependencies did you use?
- Provide a **detailed description** of what happened and donâ€™t leave any important facts out. That said, try not to include any extraneous details that could derail or distract the people trying to help reproduce the issue you found.
- Explain how the **behaviour you observed** is different from what you believe should have happened instead
- Provide supplementary information:
    - If you can reproduce and isolate the issue, use one of the [Serenity/JS Project Templates](/handbook/getting-started/project-templates/) to create a minimalistic example that demonstrates the problem and attach a link to it to your ticket. While this requires a bit more work on your side, it will help us sort out the problem much quicker.
    - If you can reproduce the issue, but can't isolate it, add the [`StreamReporter`](/api/core/class/StreamReporter) to your Serenity/JS [stage crew](/api/core/class/SerenityConfig#crew), run the test again to trigger the bug, and attach the `StreamReporter`'s log to your ticket
    - If you can't reproduce the issue, please attach any additional information that might help us figure out what happened - screenshots and test execution logs are particularly useful.
