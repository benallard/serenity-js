# Improving Serenity/JS documentation

[Serenity-js.org website](https://serenity-js.org) is made up of two main components:
- [Serenity/JS Handbook](/handbook) with articles and tutorials helping you to get started with the framework
- [Serenity/JS API Documentation](/api/) describing the public APIs available to developers using Serenity/JS to build their tests and test automation systems.

### Serenity/JS Handbook

The [Serenity/JS Handbook](/handbook) is an evolving project and there are parts of the book that you might find incomplete, or simply not written yet.

You can contribute to the evolution of the Serenity/JS Handbook by:
- correcting any errors you find - via `Edit this page` link at the bottom of each page and raising a [Pull Request](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-requests)
- sharing your ideas for topics you'd like to see covered - via [GitHub issues](https://github.com/serenity-js/serenity-js/issues/new)
- sponsoring the Serenity/JS project via the [GitHub Sponsors Programme](https://github.com/sponsors/serenity-js), so that the maintainers can secure more time to write and improve the documentation for you

:::info Commit message format
When contributing documentation changes, please make sure to follow the [Serenity/JS conventional commit message format](/community/contributing/commit-message-conventions).
For example:

```shellsession
docs(website): fixed a typo in the XYZ article
```
:::

### Serenity/JS API Docs

The [Serenity/JS API Documentation](/api) is generated automatically based on the [TSDoc comments](https://typedoc.org/guides/doccomments/) in the codebase. If you spot an issue in the API docs or want to add a new example,
 click on the <b><i class="codicon codicon-file-code"></i></b> code icon next to the name of the class or method of interest, just like [this one here](/api/core/class/Actor/#Methods).

The <b><i class="codicon codicon-file-code"></i></b> code icon will take you straight to the TSDoc used to generate a given description or example, which you can fix via Pull Request the same way you'd fix the code.

### Proposing changes to the website

The Serenity/JS website is located under [`documentation`](https://github.com/serenity-js/serenity-js/tree/main/documentation) in the [Serenity/JS mono-repo](https://github.com/serenity-js/serenity-js).

The website is built with [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/) and uses the [Docusaurus Plugin TypeDoc API](https://github.com/milesj/docusaurus-plugin-typedoc-api/) to produce the API docs.

To start the local development server, run:

```shellsession
make install
cd documentation/serenity-js.org
npm start
```

:::note
While Docusaurus supports hot reloading, the TypeDoc API plugin [does not just yet](https://github.com/milesj/docusaurus-plugin-typedoc-api/issues/25). If you're working on updating the API docs, you'll need to restart the development server to see your changes.
:::

To test the build process, run:
```shellsession
make install
make site
```

:::tip Did you know?

Serenity/JS works with [Gitpod.io](https://gitpod.io), which means you can preview Serenity/JS website and the API docs with your proposed changes right here in your browser, without having to set up or install anything on your computer.

To learn more about Gitpod, check out [Gitpod Screencasts](https://www.gitpod.io/screencasts), or jump straight into Serenity/JS codebase using the button below.
